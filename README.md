# SECURITY

**A short word but full of meaning, practical, sensitive etc but full of trouble.**

Talking and explaining about the security of projects has always been important to programmers. Because, as you know, there are some profit-seeking people in this field who are looking for a piece of code to abuse it for their own benefit and their collection.

For this reason, speaking comprehensively about the issue of security in _open source_ spaces is not only not correct, but it is not in the interest of the security framework of any communty.

For this reason, I try to point out only a series of points in the educational codes of this page so that the rules and framework of security projects are not violated by profiteers.

Correct and complete training in the field of security requires licenses, which after these licenses are provided to me, I teach them in a private totally space to interested people.

Thanks.
